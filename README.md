# My piano repertoire
The only interesting thing to see here is the [issue tracker](https://github.com/byorgey/repertoire/issues).  Each issue corresponds to a piece in my repertoire.  The issues will never be closed, only edited over time as I practice them.  I have a [Beeminder](https://www.beeminder.com/) [goal](https://www.beeminder.com/byorgey/freshen-piano) to practice the piece corresponding to the least-recently-edited issue and/or add new pieces over time.
